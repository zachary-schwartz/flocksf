# Mountain View Suspends Flock Pilot Program
Following a public record request submitted by the Mountain View Voice it was discovered that federal agencies were accessing Mountain View’s cameras. Police Chief Mike Canfield has disabled the city's 30 cameras in response to this news. The city council will address the issue and future of the program on February 24th. The issue creates significant concern about local governments being able to control the data they collect on citizens.
