# Former Teacher Drops Case Against City Over Flock
Michael Moore, a San Francisco resident and former teacher has dropped his lawsuit against San Francisco over their use of Flock cameras. On Tuesday Moore’s lawyer filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, terminating the case. This case was an important action to fight against surveillance, making this development quite unfortunate. No reason was given for why the case was ended making the rationale unclear. However there is still a possibility of refiling when there is more evidence available, if a lack of evidence was the reason for dismissal.
