            <p class="description">Officers have acted on faulty warrant identifications by flock cameras,
                putting
                innocent citizens in danger. For example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlHL7bhMb1M">a man
                    was falsely arrested in Seattle</a>
                when his car was flagged by a flock camera because his son (who has the same) had a felony
