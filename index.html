            <p>Flock is a brand of Automated License Plate Reader (ALPR) that has spread all over the US in the last few
                years. In total it is estimated that there are around 100,000 cameras which in total scan 20 billion
                license plates per month. What makes Flock different then many other ALPR companies is how they share
                data. Flock automatically shares camera data with other police departments, allowing them to search for
                license plates across the country.</p>

                putting
                innocent citizens in danger. For example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlHL7bhMb1M">a
